## 💫 Welcome to my GitHub! 👋  

I’m a **Backend Developer & AI Engineer** with a passion for solving complex engineering challenges at scale.  
From architecting systems handling **500M+ records** to building **RAG-based AI agents**, I thrive at the intersection of **scalability, performance, and intelligence**.  

I’ve pioneered automation-driven AI solutions by integrating **LangChain, CrewAI, MCP, and n8n workflows**, transforming operations and accelerating delivery cycles.  
I’ve also optimized database infrastructure, cutting costs by **15%** through sharding and indexing strategies, and cleared a **190-day backlog in under a month** through technical innovation.
